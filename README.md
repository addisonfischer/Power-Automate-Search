### Power Automate Search

This is a really basic tool created on a whim to help out my company team and hopefully many others.

There are quite a few features I would like to add, so be on the look out for those- also, please feel free to suggest commits/changes and new features/bug fixes/optimizations!



# Installation:
Option 1:
Download paSearch.dll from the releases tab and move the file into your XrmToolBox plugin directory (Win: %APPDATA%\MscrmTools\XrmToolBox\Plugins)
Option 2:
Wait for the tool to be registered with XrmToolBox and search within the app!

# Usage:
- Connect to your organization
- Search and go!
  - You have the option to select from the type of power automate object or simply search all of them
  - Leaving the search blank will return everything
  - Double clicking a line will copy the name of the PA object
 
# Future improvements:
- Automatic opening of solutions upon double click (open to suggestions on how to do this)
- Change search function to utilize fuzzy finding
